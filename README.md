# Weekly Reports

## Week 8
### Paper Sharing
Two paper reading reports respectively on Few-shot learning and light model structures. <br>
1. [Model-Agnostic Boundary-Adversarial Sampling for Test-Time Generalization in Few-Shot learning](Papernote%20MABAS/Papernote%20MABAS.pdf) 
2. [GhostNet: More Features from Cheap Operations](Papernote%20GhostNet/Papernote%20GhostNet.pdf) 
<br>

### Summary & Plans
1. Work in this week:
    * Learning about neural network.
    * Read papers as the clue of [Few-shot Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05046.pdf)

2. Plan for next week:
    * Try to implement DMT Algorithm with lightened NN modules
