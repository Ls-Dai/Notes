# Weekly Reports

## Week 8
### Paper Sharing
Two paper reading reports respectively on Few-shot learning and light model structures. <br>
1. [Model-Agnostic Boundary-Adversarial Sampling for Test-Time Generalization in Few-Shot learning](Papernote%20MABAS/Papernote%20MABAS.pdf) 
2. [GhostNet: More Features from Cheap Operations](Papernote%20GhostNet/Papernote%20GhostNet.pdf) 
<br>

### Summary & Plans
